## Description

This is a clock application built with React and Bootstrap, designed to implement a countdown timer with session and break periods, inspired by the freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries project requirements.

## Dependencies

- The Clock + 5 application allows you to set the length of both the session and break periods.
- Use the "-" and "+" buttons next to "Break Length" and "Session Length" to adjust the lengths as desired.

- Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer to its initial state.
- When the timer reaches zero, an audio alert will play.
